**Added:**

* Parameters for Green Bank Telescope
* Example using GBT.
* Calculations for further important angles for bistatic radars.

**Changed:**

* Changed bistatic depolarization calculation. Weighted by cos(beta)^2 instead of half angle. This will work for only VV polarizations. Need calculations for other polarizations.
